What is exception handling and problem it solves?

Exception handling anticipates errors and manages those errors
in a way that prevents the program itself from crashing. Exception
handling could be built around user input, for example, when
asking for an integer for some operation. If the user passes a 
string instead (which may raise an exception in a method), then
exception handling message can be created to prevent the program
from crashing. These use the begin, rescue, and end reserved words.
