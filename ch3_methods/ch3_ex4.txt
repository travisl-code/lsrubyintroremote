def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  return
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

Explicit return before line 4 means line 4 won't execute.
There would be no output to console, but return would be Yippeee!!!!
The scream method takes one parameter (string arg "Yippeee"),
and the method concats that arg (words) with !!!! and returns it
