Hashes -- Exercise 1:
Provided a hash of family members where the key is relation
and the value is a list of relatives, we're asked to find
only immediate family members (sisters and brothers). 
We use the or || operator to get k == :sisters || k == :brothers
However, I thought that || was a non-greedy operation, meaning that
if Ruby finds something on the first attempt, it won't even try the 2nd.
