# READ ME #
This is my first time learning Ruby, first time learning a programming
language at all, really. I have dabbled in some Python scripts using
a learning platform that's pretty popular. I don't feel like that was
enough to make me feel like a programming student though. I needed more
and here I am.

So, update in Dec. 2021... I was taking some online classes at a local
college and didn't have time to continue following the Launch School
curriculum. However, because I feel like it was helpful (and better paced
for my learning style) that I returned. I went through the Intro to 
Programming book and completed the exercises once again. I think this was
a great help to solidify some of the things I learned and partially 
learned last time around.
